# AutoML-Universal-Bank-Dataset

A AutoML predictive analysis of customers accepting a personal loan via DataRobot.

This was a DataRobot-based project using 8 models to predict whether customers would accept a personal loan from their bank. Eight models were generated and compared to previously generated SAS-EM-based models to demonstrate the pros and cons of using AutoML. The model types included: gradient boosting, naive bayes, logistic regression, neural network, and SVMs. The best model (gradient boosting) generated a 96.4% accuracy and 100% sensitivity, improving accuracy of true positives from the baseline by 9% and from the best SAS-EM-based models by 1%.
